This repository contains three machine learning and data analysis projects completed as part of my Data Science internship with CodeAlpha. Each project explores real-world data using Python, visualization, and ML techniques.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Iris Flower Classification
A classification model that predicts Iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements using Scikit-learn.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Car Price Prediction
A regression model to estimate car prices based on various features like brand, horsepower, and mileage.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Unemployment Analysis in India
Analyzed unemployment trends across Indian states using visualization techniques. Highlighted patterns based on age, region, and time using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data
Created a regression model to predict product sales based on advertising spend across TV, radio, and newspapers. Explored how different media affect sales performance.
